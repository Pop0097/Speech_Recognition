# Speech_Recognition

Machine learning program that recognizes a user's voice.

# Inspiration

I made this program to learn more about audio processing, TensorFlow, and machine learning. It was inspired by Apple's "Hey Siri."

# How it works

1. The user will record themselves saying "Hey Pop" five times. Afterwards, the progarm will process the audio and use TensorFlow to create a keras model to recognize for the user's voice.
2. Once the model is made, the user can say "Hey Pop" into their microphone and the program will identify whether it is the original user or now.
